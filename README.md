# Project 
Short Description of Project:
- It is a Discord bot that utilizes Canvas API to allow users to interact with Canvas in Discord. It is only for personal use, so only a personal Canvas key / token is required for the bot to interact with Canvas.

Vision Statement: 
- For college students who utilize Discord servers for their college classes and whose colleges utilize Canvas, the Canvas Discord Bot is a Discord bot that facilitates communication between the Discord server and the corresponding college class the server is centered around. Unlike the previous solution, which required users to go back and forth between the Discord and Canvas applications, users of the Canvas Discord Bot can use simple commands within their Discord servers to pull information about their classes from Canvas without leaving the application. 

Three Personas:
1. Dane, age 20, is a college student at Temple University in urban Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He has used the internet for as long as he can remember, and is an avid player of video games. Many times in the past and in the present, Dane has used Discord for communication with friends and teammates in the video games he plays every night. Dane is a computer science major at Temple, and the crafty students in his classes always create a Discord server for classmates to discuss projects and assignments for each class. Dane loves communicating in these servers, and enjoys the collaboration between classmates. He is interested in the Canvas Discord bot in order to receive notifications about when assignments in his classes are due, in addition to being notified about announcements from his professor. 

2. Spongebob is a freshman student at Harvard University who specializes in CS. He uses discord primarily for classes and gaming. He would use discord whenever he is on his computer, and knows every feature Discord provides. He is familiar with discord bots and maintaining multiple servers. He would be interested in and would like to have Canvas features built inside Discord, so that he would not miss any important notifications from Canvas when he is gaming or chatting with his friends or in classes.
